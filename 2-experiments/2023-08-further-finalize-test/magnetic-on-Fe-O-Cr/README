The calculation to see if magnetization should be turned on for Fe/O/Cr convergence tests.

Run on cohesive energy convergence tests for Fe/O/Cr, because cohesive energy not dependent on reference data which also may cause problems. Meanwhile it usually give the largest cutoff energy.

Run using GS convergence tests for Fe/O/Cr with magnetization turned on.
Keep on GS rather than Diamond because the Diamond tests are not yet working.

Compare the results with the results from the Diamond convergence tests for Fe/O/Cr with magnetization turned off.
